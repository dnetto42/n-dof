# N-DOF: The Modular Robotic Arm

### https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4546364

This project uses connectors that are compatible with [Modular Mounting System (MMS)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2194278) and [GoPro](https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=gopro) to join motorized robotic modules.

## Features:

 - **Modular**: Ideal for flexible use and re-use. Try different arm designs without having to re-print parts. Disassemble and reassemble with ease.
 - **Limitless**: Print the same part multiple times and chain them together. N-DOF = "N Degrees of Freedom".
 - **Extensible**: Have a motor or actuator you want to use in your own robot? Design a joint with GoPro mounts separated by 30 mm... Now it is N-DOF compatible!
 - **Compatible**: There are a huge number of mounts for various objects that are compatible with N-DOF. Search for "Modular Mounting System" or "GoPro".

## Included Modules:

 - Included modules use **print-in-place joints** to keep part count low. They require supports and a little force to move for the first time.
 - Included modules use **NEMA 17** stepping motors.
 - The only non-printed parts required are **M3 bolts** to mount the motors.
 
If you are thinking of designing a module that is compatible with N-DOF, these features are not a requirement.

### Base

![N-DOF BASE](https://i.imgur.com/xpi3DVH.png)

 - Gear ratio = 6:1
 - Support blockers when slicing may help support removal.
 - If greater stability is required, print some [MMS arms](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2194278) to spread the legs out further.
 - 2 x M3 bolts required to mount NEMA 17.
 - 6 x legs.
 - 1 x motor gear (with 12 teeth).
 
### Gear Joint

![N-DOF GEAR JOINT](https://i.imgur.com/qK0Ncev.png)

 - Gear ratio = 4:1
 - Support blockers when slicing may help support removal.
 - This joint has an asymmetric range of motion: -60 deg to 150 deg.
 - 3 x M3 bolts required to mount NEMA 17.
 - 1 x motor gear (with 12 teeth).
 
### Swivel Joint

 - No gearing.
 - This could be improved using planetary gears.
 - 4 x M3 bolts required to mount NEMA 17.
 
## Notes:

 - Regular PLA might not be strong enough for the M5 bolts. I used [PolyMax PLA](https://polymaker.com/product/polymax-pla/) and have had no issues.
 - If extending the arm to great lengths, be sure to attach the base to a desk with a clamp so it doesn't tip over.
 - OpenSCAD files are included.
